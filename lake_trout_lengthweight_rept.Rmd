## Length-Weight Relationship for Each Lake

### Model

A log-log regression was used to model weight as a function of length, expanding somewhat on the form used by Lester, et al.  Since fish-level data (lengths and weights) were available from several lakes of differing habitat, the length-weight relationships were fit separately for each lake, with slope and intercept parameters modeled hierarchically as shown below.

$log(W_{j[i]}) = \beta_{0[j]} + \beta_{1[j]}log(L_{j[i]}) + \epsilon_i$

which is equivalent to

$W = e^{\beta_{0[j]}} \times L^{\beta_{1[j]}} \times e^{\epsilon_i}$

in which

$\beta_{0[j]} \sim N(\mu_{\beta_0}, \sigma_{\beta_0}) \text{ for } j \in 1...n_{lakes}$

$\beta_{1[j]} \sim N(\mu_{\beta_1}, \sigma_{\beta_1}) \text{ for } j \in 1...n_{lakes}$

$\epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma_{\epsilon})$

Modeling lake-level slope and intercept parameters hierarchically allows for variability in the length-weight relationship between lakes, but also allows the overall relationship to inform data-poor cases.

Note: The model was extended to explore possible relationships between lake area and latitude on the length-weight relationship, with some weak relationships identified but fairly equivalent inferences for the lake parameters.  See Appendix for more details.

### Results

```{r, fig.show='hide'}
# loading all the data, but hiding the data exploration plots, etc
source("R/1_laketrout_lwdata.R")

laketrout_lw <- filter(laketrout_lw, !is.na(SurfaceArea_h))

logarea <- log(with(laketrout_lw, tapply(SurfaceArea_h, LakeName, median, na.rm=T)))
lat <- with(laketrout_lw, tapply(Latitude_WGS84, LakeName, median))
lakenames <- names(lat)
```

Parameter estimates are given below for all lakes with paired length-weight data as well as lake area and latitude.  

Note: the model was fit using recentered log-lengths to facilitate model convergence (see inference for $\beta_{0c}$ below), but parameters were back-transformed for interpretability (see inference for $\beta_0$ below.)

```{r}
load(file="alloutputs.Rdata")

out_tbl <- data.frame(Lake = lakenames,
                      beta_0 = alloutputs[[1]]$q50$b0_interp,
                      SE_beta_0 = alloutputs[[1]]$sd$b0_interp,
                      beta_0_c = alloutputs[[1]]$q50$b0,
                      SE_beta_0_c = alloutputs[[1]]$sd$b0,
                      beta_1 = alloutputs[[1]]$q50$b1,
                      SE_beta_1 = alloutputs[[1]]$sd$b1)

                    "beta_0c", "SE(beta_0c)", 
                    "beta_1", "SE(beta_1)")

### Length-Weight Relationship

#### Data

The raw data consisted of 3,887 paired length x weight measurements from 24 lakes, and 57 sampling events from 1960-2022.  Raw data are plotted below.

```{r}
laketrout_all %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ForkLength_mm, y=Weight_g)) +#, 
             # colour=LakeName)) +
  geom_point(alpha=.3) +
  # facet_wrap(facets=~LakeName) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_bw()
```

A cluster of points in the lower right were best explained by weight having been entered as kilograms rather than grams.  These entries were adjusted according to this assumption.

Obvious outliers were removed according to the rules: weight > 100,000g, length < 150mm.

```{r}
laketrout_lw_filter1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ForkLength_mm, y=Weight_g, 
             colour=LakeName)) +
  geom_point(alpha=.3) +
  # facet_wrap(facets=~LakeName) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_bw()


laketrout_lw_filter1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ForkLength_mm, y=Weight_g)) +
  geom_point(alpha=.3) +
  facet_wrap(facets=~LakeName) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_bw()
```

Many observations from Paxson Lake showed substantial deviations from the trend.  Residual analysis showed this phenomenon to be related to data from a few specific projects.  It was not clear whether this was an artifact of sampling, or if errors were introduced in data entry or data sorting, etc.  Regardless, the data from these projects were censored from the length-weight analysis.

A number of observations still showed large deviations from the trend, likely due to data entry or transcription errors.  These were removed by fitting a global linear regression model, and removing the points with residuals greater than $\pm 4$ times the residual standard deviation, shown below.

```{r}
plot(laketrout_lw_filter2$ForkLength_mm, laketrout_lw_filter2$Weight_g,
     log="xy", xlab="Fork Length (mm)", ylab="Weight (g)",
     pch=ifelse(lm_filter2$residuals/sd(lm_filter2$residuals) > -4 &
         lm_filter2$residuals/sd(lm_filter2$residuals) < 4, 1, 16),
     col=adjustcolor(1,alpha.f=.6))
```

#### Modeling

A log-log regression was used to model weight as a function of length, expanding somewhat on the form used by Lester, et al.  Since fish-level data (lengths and weights) were available from several lakes of differing habitat, the length-weight relationships were fit separately for each lake, with the base model defining slope and intercept parameters as modeled hierarchically, shown below.

$log(W_{j[i]}) = \beta_{0[j]} + \beta_{1[j]}log(L_{j[i]}) + \epsilon_i$

which is equivalent to

$W = e^{\beta_{0[j]}} \times L^{\beta_{1[j]}} \times e^{\epsilon_i}$

in which

$\beta_{0[j]} \sim N(\mu_{\beta_0}, \sigma_{\beta_0}) \text{ for } j \in 1...n_{lakes}$

$\beta_{1[j]} \sim N(\mu_{\beta_1}, \sigma_{\beta_1}) \text{ for } j \in 1...n_{lakes}$

$\epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma_{\epsilon})$

This was extended to allow possible relationships between the lake-level intercept parameters $\beta_{0[j]}$ and slope parameters $\beta_{1[j]}$ and both lake area and latitude.  The full model extension is expressed below.

$\beta_{0[j]} \sim N(\mu_{\beta_0[j]}, \sigma_{\beta_0}) \text{ for } j \in 1...n_{lakes}$

$\beta_{1[j]} \sim N(\mu_{\beta_1[j]}, \sigma_{\beta_1}) \text{ for } j \in 1...n_{lakes}$

$\mu_{\beta_0[j]} = \gamma_0 + \tau_{0,Area}log(Area_j) + \tau_{0,Lat}Latitude_j \text{ for } j \in 1...n_{lakes}$

$\mu_{\beta_1[j]} = \gamma_1 + \tau_{1,Area}log(Area_j) + \tau_{1,Lat}Latitude_j \text{ for } j \in 1...n_{lakes}$

$\epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma_{\epsilon})$

Models were fit for all possible combinations of relationships, and were compared according to DIC scores, as tabulated below.

To illustrate the possible relationships between lake-level variables (log-area and latitude) and lake-level slope and intercept parameters, parameters are plotted for model 7.  This was the top-performing model in terms of DIC, and was defined as the lake-level intercept parameters having a linear relationship with log area, and the lake-level slope parameters having a linear relationship with latitude.

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=9}
# bundle data to pass into JAGS
laketrout_lw <- filter(laketrout_lw, !is.na(SurfaceArea_h))

logarea <- log(with(laketrout_lw, tapply(SurfaceArea_h, LakeName, median, na.rm=T)))
lat <- with(laketrout_lw, tapply(Latitude_WGS84, LakeName, median))

lt_data <- list(x=log(laketrout_lw$ForkLength_mm) - mean(log(laketrout_lw$ForkLength_mm)),
                y=log(laketrout_lw$Weight_g/1000),
                n=nrow(laketrout_lw),
                lake=as.numeric(as.factor(laketrout_lw$LakeName)),
                nlake=length(unique(laketrout_lw$LakeName)),
                meanx = mean(log(laketrout_lw$ForkLength_mm)),
                lat=lat - mean(lat),
                area=logarea - mean(logarea))
lt_data$xpred <- seq(from=min(lt_data$x), to=max(lt_data$x), length.out=30)
lt_data$npred <- length(lt_data$xpred)

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
caterpillar(alloutputs[[7]], p="b0", x=lat, xlab="latitude", ylab="lake-level parameter value")
caterpillar(alloutputs[[7]], p="b1", x=lat, xlab="latitude", ylab="lake-level parameter value")
envelope(alloutputs[[7]], p="mu_b1", x=lat, add=TRUE, dark=.2)
caterpillar(alloutputs[[7]], p="b0", x=logarea, xlab="log area", ylab="lake-level parameter value")
envelope(alloutputs[[7]], p="mu_b0", x=logarea, add=TRUE, dark=.2)
caterpillar(alloutputs[[7]], p="b1", x=logarea, xlab="log area", ylab="lake-level parameter value")
```

It is important to compare the differences between inferences in terms of lake-level parameters, among the models considered.  Here the lake-level intercept (b0) and slope (b1) parameters are compared, for the top-performing models for each number of additional parameters (see table below).

```{r}
knitr::kable(model_df[bestmodels,], digits=2)
```

Note that slight differences in inference exist between models, though all differences are very slight.  Dotted lines are overlayed as appropriate, for comparison with the fit reported in Lester et al.

```{r, fig.height=15}
bestoutputs <- alloutputs[bestmodels]

par(mfrow=c(3,1))
comparecat(bestoutputs, p="b0_interp[", col=1:5, main="b0")
abline(h=-19.56, lty=3)
comparecat(bestoutputs, p="b0[", col=1:5, main="b0 (centered)")
comparecat(bestoutputs, p="b1[", col=1:5, main="b1")
abline(h=3.2, lty=3)
```

That said, it may be beneficial to consider the relationships with latitude and log-area when modeling the length-weight relationship for a new lake *outside* the list presented.

Since model fitting was done using recentered data (log length, log area, latitude), some algebraic headache was required to backtransform all parameters back to the data scale, and is not shown here.  Since the net relationship between log length and log weight contains several sources of uncertainty (error in parameter estimation, errors in hierarchical distributions, residual error), error in expressing the length-weight relationship for a new lake is best calculated in-model or directly from the posterior.  However, the formula below should be sufficient for point estimates of regression parameters.

Note: weight is expressed in kilograms, length in millimeters, area in hectares, and latitude in degrees.

g0 <- alloutputs[[7]]$q50$b0_int

meanlogA <- mean(log(laketrout_lw$SurfaceArea_h))
meanlogL <- mean(log(laketrout_lw$ForkLength_mm))
